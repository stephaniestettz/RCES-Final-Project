### Scientific Question
Is there a relationship between the number of recorded cases of 10 communicable diseases and air temperature in New York City from 2000 to 2016.

### Datasets
NYCData Communicable Disease Surveillance Data: 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Communicable-Disease-Surveillance-Data/gff2-veif

NOAA NCEP-NCAR CDAS-1 MONTHLY temperature data from IRI Data Library:
https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP-NCAR/.CDAS-1/.MONTHLY/

### Summary of Intended Project
I will attempt to determine if there is a correlation between the number of communicable disease cases from 2000 to 2016 in NYC and the temperature record. I will also see if certain types of communicable diseases have an increased or decreased number of cases due to changes in temperature.  I will complete this analysis using pandas, xarray, and potentially Statsmodels.
